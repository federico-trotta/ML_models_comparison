# ML MODELS COMPARISON

This repository is a comparison between two ML learning models (Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbour).
I did this excercise as a beginner in ML, and since I found that for this dataset both algorithms could be valuable,
my struggle was on how to decide which ML algorithms to use, knowing that there are many out there.

I decided to write a Medium post on this topic; you can read it there:

In this repo you find the CVS with the data, but the complete source is here:

Feel free to share this work and to give me advices. Thanks! :)
